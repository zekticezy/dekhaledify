# Intro
Welcome to the GitHub repository of the open-source Spicetify plugin Dekhaledify! 

This is an extension that automatically skips all DJ Khaled song intros for you, so you can enjoy your favorite songs without *They ain't believe in us, GOD DID!* or *DJ KHALED!*

### What anger and hatred inside me prompted me to create this extension.
Okay! So:

My favorite album of ALL time is SoFaygo's [*Pink Heartz*](https://open.spotify.com/album/1POWgdYTzfFt9rhKlXFwsU). Unfortunately, on that album is track 13 - **TookOff (feat. Gunna & DJ Khaled**. If you've listened to it, the intro isn't that good, thanks to - you guessed it - DJ Khaled.

To make sure I never have to hear that man's voice again, I coded this extension. I decided to make it free and open-source so that nobody had to go through my pain aswell anymore.
